			<p>The influence of college athletics on a school’s culture is especially prominent at universities with successful and iconic athletic programs, like Clemson University, and UT Austin. </p>
</section>
	<p>Specifically, football is a top-revenue-generating sport for many universities nationwide. At schools with these prolific athletic programs, the success of their football teams year to year can have grave impacts on things like alumni engagement, which can consequently impact the university’s overall spending and the way they allocate their budget. </p>
</section>

<p>I consulted a story done by the <a href="https://harbert.auburn.edu/binaries/documents/center-for-ethical-organizational-cultures/cases/ncaa.pdf" target="_blank">The Center for Ethical Organizational Culture at Auburn University</a> that outlined how  vital the profits generated by successful sports teams are to their respective schools. From filling stadium seats, to increasing TV viewership, to  encouraging alumni donations, athletic programs play an imperative financial role. </p>

</section>
<p>The findings of the article concluded that athletics programs have the potential to generate not only profits but also a sense of loyalty among its fans - which strengthens the school culture. Schools make decisions to delve into multi-million dollar projects to reconstruct and renovate their football stadiums in hopes of creating this shared sense of pride and community within their universities. The University of Arizona, and the University of Alabama have passed multi-million dollar proposals to renovated athletic facilities and stadiums. </p>

			<h3> College football programs across the U.S. experienced an extreme drop in total revenue in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </h3>
			<p>Football can generate as much as $150 million annually at some schools with top-tier programs. At these schools, football alone can make up 75% of that total revenue. </p>
			</section>
<p>The 2020-2021 football season had a rocky start with several prolific programs like Ohio State, Clemson, and UT Austin reporting players with positive COVID-19 cases.  </p>
</section>
<p>Star players who were benched because of exposure to the disease decreased the competitiveness and excitement of games. Additionally, fans could only attend games if they abided by the state's social distancing guidelines. 
</p>
</section>
<p> As a result, fewer tickets were sold, viewership decreased with less competive play and an uncertain and less exciting season. Revenue generated from football plummeted, and these schools were directly impacted. Athletic directors were forced to make cuts, schools had to adjust their overall spending, and school comradery, alumni engagement, and media visiblity decreased. </p>

			<h3> Donor's Play a Significant Role in Clemson's Revenue </h3>
			<p>Keeping donors engaged is imparative to the success of college sports.</p>
			</section>
			<p>As sports become more and more advanced and competive, the cost of scholarships for athlets, facility maintence and renovations, and coaching salaries have steadily increased. </p>
			</section>
			<p>Consequently, schools depend heavily on alumni engagement and donor contributions to increase revenue. These donors provide financial stability, and support efforts made by universities to improve their sports teams. </p>
		</section>
		<p>From funding scholarship aid for student athlets, to upgrades to training and athletic facilities, to improvements to the stadium and fan experience, donors are a vital resource to fund these enhancements. </p>
